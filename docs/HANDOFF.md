# Handoff

State of the Colby planning work, for a new session. Branch: `claude/combustion-desktop-plan`.

## Done

| Area | Where |
|---|---|
| Protocol notes (BLE spec digest) | `01-protocol-notes.md` |
| API design (core, links, stores, commands, alerts, clock, recording, UI-facing additions §18) | `02-api-design.md` |
| Roadmap, decisions log, risks | `03-roadmap.md` |
| Release, TestFlight / package flights, crash reporting | `04-release-and-beta.md` |
| Test strategy | `05-test-strategy.md` |
| UX plan (current design rules: §4, §8, §13, §17.5, §18) | `06-ux-plan.md` |
| Design tokens + component specs | `design/tokens.json`, `design/components.md` |
| Design canvas (23 boards) | https://claude.ai/artifact/SptGVDutqLHwzLb7hUJeGU (private); source in `design/canvas/` |
| Screenshots (always regenerated together) | `design/screenshots/` |

## Key decisions (full list: README, 03 decisions log, 06 §1 / §17.5)

- Native per OS: Swift/SwiftUI/CoreBluetooth (macOS first), C#/WinUI 3/WinRT (Windows). Mac App Store + Microsoft Store only. Free.
- Probe direct + MeatNet nodes. Commands: set prediction, set high/low alarms, silence.
- Dark only. Official-app look: sensor colors Core `#4ea1f7`, Surface `#ffb81c`, Ambient `#f5701f`; pill readouts; scrubbable graph with dots.
- Single probe is the main case; every surface has a 1-probe version. Completion time shown next to every countdown.
- Built-in sounds only; bundled Barlow + Barlow Condensed.

## Continue the design

1. Edit boards in `design/canvas/*.dc.html` (Design Component format; see the canvas artifact's `artifact-type/reference/format.md`).
2. Publish: Artifact publish with `url` = canvas link, `root` = a folder whose `project/` holds the files (copy `design/canvas/*` into `<root>/project/`), `file_path` = changed file. Read the artifact first in a new session.
3. Get the runtime once: Artifact read, `url` = canvas link, `path` = `artifact-type/dc-runtime.js`.
4. Render: `docs/design/tools/render-all.sh <dc-runtime.js>`. Uses Playwright from `/opt/node-tools` (cloud container); change the import in `tools/shoot.mjs` elsewhere.
5. Look at every screenshot before reporting; copy any canvas change back into `design/canvas/`.

Format gotchas: SVG `<text>` with `{{holes}}` does not render, so chart labels are absolutely positioned HTML; use `defaultValue`/`defaultChecked` on static inputs; full-page screenshots cancel hover, so the hover mode resizes the viewport first.

## Open items

| # | Item |
|---|---|
| 1 | App icon / logo |
| 2 | Barlow Condensed tabular figures check in SwiftUI and WinUI (M2 spike) |
| 3 | Usability test (06 §15 U5) |
| 4 | Optional interactive prototype (U4) |

## Next: implementation

Start macOS M0–M3 (`03-roadmap.md`): capture real probe traffic into `spec/replays` and `spec/fixtures`, then the Swift codec against the shared fixtures, then CoreBluetooth transport and ProbeStore. None of these depend on the open UX items.
